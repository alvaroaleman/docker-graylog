# Graylog Docker images collection

Hi there. This repository contains unofficial [graylog][graylog] Docker images
that can be used in various deployments.

Feel free to explore or send pull requests.

Oh, by the way, there's single-node docker-compose file included for those who
wanna play (even though server container coughs on mongo dying faster it).
